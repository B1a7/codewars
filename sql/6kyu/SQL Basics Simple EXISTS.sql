-- For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement that will contain data about departments that had a sale with a price over 98.00 dollars. This SELECT statement will have to use an EXISTS to achieve the task.

-- departments table schema
-- id
-- name
-- sales table schema
-- id
-- department_id (department foreign key)
-- name
-- price
-- card_name
-- card_number
-- transaction_date
-- resultant table schema
-- id
-- name
-- NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing. Do not: alias tables as this can cause a failure.



SELECT id, name
FROM departments
WHERE EXISTS
(
     SELECT * FROM departments
     INNER JOIN sales
     ON departments.id = sales.department_id
     WHERE price > 98.00
);
